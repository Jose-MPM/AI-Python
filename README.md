# AI-Python Repository

## Overview

Welcome to the AI-Python repository, a collection of Python projects related to Artificial Intelligence. Below is an organized structure of the repository along with brief descriptions of each work.

### Structure

* **fine tuning gpt2-diagnosis vs LSTM vs Naive Bayes Classifier**: The goal of this project is to perform fine-tuning on GPT-2 using a dataset of medical diagnostics. The aim is to obtain a model capable of generating accurate diagnoses based on input descriptions of symptoms. We will compare this fine-tuned GPT-2 model with other models generated using various methods. The objective is to determine the optimal way to leverage the dataset and achieve the best possible performance.
    - [gpt2_diagnosis](gpt2-diagnosis/gpt2_diagnosis.ipynb): Jupyter Notebook implementing diagnosis using GPT-2.
    - [LSTM](gpt2-diagnosis/LSTM.ipynb): Jupyter Notebook focusing on Long Short-Term Memory networks.
    - [NaiveBayes](gpt2-diagnosis/NaiveBayes.ipynb): Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the Naive Bayes classifier.

* **Neuronal-Networks**
    - **DAE (Denoising Autoencoders)**: Jupyter Notebook and presentation on Denoising Autoencoders.
        - [DAEs](Neuronal-Networks/DAE/DAEs.ipynb)
        - [DAEs Presentation](Neuronal-Networks/DAE/DAEsPresentation.pdf)
    - [Ejercicios_Pandas](Neuronal-Networks/Ejercicios_Pandas.ipynb): Notebook with exercises related to Pandas.
    - [Ejercicios_Repaso_Python](Neuronal-Networks/Ejercicios_Repaso_Python.ipynb): Jupyter Notebook containing Python review exercises.
    - [Mathematical Building Blocks](Neuronal-Networks/mathematical_building_blocks_i.ipynb): Jupyter Notebook covering mathematical foundations for neural networks.


* **Basic**
    - [Conceptos b√°sicos de probabilidad y estad√≠stica](Basic/Conceptos%20basicos%20de%20probabilidad%20y%20estadistica.ipynb): Jupyter Notebook covering fundamental concepts in probability and statistics, such as random variables, distribution function, correlation, etc.
    - [Correlaci√≥n y distribuciones](Basic/Correlacion%20y%20distribuciones.ipynb) Jupyter Notebook exploring correlation and probability distributions.
    - [k-means and k-medoids](Basic/K-means%20y%20K-MEDOIDS/k-means.ipynb): Notebook implementing k-means clustering and k-medoids algorithms.
    - [ADD-BA](Basic/ADD-BA.ipynb) - Implementing Decision Trees and Random Forest.
