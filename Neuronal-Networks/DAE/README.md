- GitHub Repository: Autoencoder-Denoising(This)
- Technologies: Python, TensorFlow (Keras), scikit-learn

## Introduction

In the "Autoencoder for Image Denoising" project, we delve into the realm of enhancing image quality by employing autoencoder architecture. An autoencoder is a neural network topology designed to reconstruct its input while seeking a compact representation of the provided information. This project specifically focuses on utilizing autoencoders for denoising images, aiming to improve image quality by removing unwanted noise.
### Project Details
* Autoencoder Architecture

    - Encoder: The encoder compresses the input into a lower-dimensional latent space, capturing essential information.
    
        - Two convolutional layers capture local patterns, and a dropout layer aids regularization.
    
        - Flattening and a dense layer with 16 neurons define the latent space.

    - Decoder: The decoder reconstructs the original input from the compressed representation.
        - Dense and reshape layers expand the latent vector.
        - Two transposed convolutional layers reverse the effects of encoding.
        - The output layer uses a sigmoid activation function for pixel values in the [0,1] range.

* Dataset

    - Utilized the MNIST dataset, consisting of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 to 9).
    - 60,000 images with added noise for training and 10,000 for testing.
    - Noise introduced through a randomly generated normal distribution.

* Model Training

    - Optimized using the Adam optimizer and Mean Squared Error as the loss function.
    - Implemented the ReduceLROnPlateau callback to dynamically adjust the learning rate during training.
    - Employed convolutional layers to capture local patterns efficiently.
    - Used ReLU activation for non-linearity, crucial for learning complex relationships in image data.

* Results and Conclusion

    * Achieved an impressive Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0137, indicating precise reconstruction despite the presence of noise.
    - Visualized original images, noisy images, and reconstructed images for qualitative assessment.
    - Demonstrated the model's ability to reduce noise effectively, enhancing image quality.

- Key Takeaways

    - Leveraging convolutional layers for structured data (images) captures local patterns and hierarchies of features effectively.
    - Carefully chosen activation functions, such as ReLU, contribute to learning non-linear representations crucial for image data.
    - The addition of noise during training proved to be a valuable strategy, improving the model's ability to generalize to real-world noisy data.

- Conclusion
    - The "Autoencoder for Image Denoising" project showcases the power of autoencoders in enhancing image quality by effectively removing noise. The careful design of the architecture, data preprocessing, and training strategies led to a robust model capable of generalizing well to real-world noisy images.
